To achieve an accuracy of 96% in a KNN cancer classification model, you can follow these steps:

Load the cancer dataset.
Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize data).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a KNN model with a specific value of k.
Evaluate the model using cross-validation or a separate validation set.
Repeat steps 4 and 5 with different values of k to find the best model.
Once you find a model with an accuracy of 96%, you can use it for cancer classification.
